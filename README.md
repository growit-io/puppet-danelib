## Development

Dalenys  modules  on   the  Puppet  Forge  are  open   projects,  and  community
contributions are  essential for keeping them  great.  We can't access  the huge
number  of   platforms  and  myriad   of  hardware,  software,   and  deployment
configurations that  Puppet is intended to  serve so feel free  to contribute on
GitHub.

Thanks https://github.com/puppetlabs/ for help to write this README :)
